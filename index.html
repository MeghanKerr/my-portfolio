            Hi, I'm Meghan Kerr! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am a developer with 24 years of experience.  For over 10 years I worked for Unisys on
            their 4GL language Agile Business Suite (previously named LINC and also EAE) coding in 
            LINC, Cobol and C++.
            For over 10 years I also worked on the ETL Unisys Data Exchange which transforms data in 
            real time from the Unisys mainframe data stores (DMSII, RDMS and DMS) to SQL, Oracle and 
            Kafka using C#. 
            Whilst my working career has been backend coding I am trying to expand my skillset to include
            front end coding by completing the IBM Full Stack Developer course as well as taking on 
            work in the front end of Unisys Data Exchange product when fixing bugs and developing new features.
            I have held numerous positions during my time at Unisys including team lead and project manager.
            I have worked on many new releases of the two mentioned products developing new features, 
            support work (including two successful trips to Brazil providing on site support), training
            fellow engineers (I successfully trained a new team in India to take ownership of the MCP 
            Target Builder code) and developing new product release training videos.

          I've seen Meghan work well in a team and individually.  I've seen Meghan
          work as an engineer and a team lead, working very well in both roles.
